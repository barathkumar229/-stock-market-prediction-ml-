# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression. It involves preprocessing historical stock data, training a model, and making predictions.

## Folder Structure

- `src/` - Contains preprocessing, model training, and prediction scripts.
- `models/` - Stores trained model files.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experiments.
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python libraries.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the scripts inside `src/` to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
